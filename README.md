# Mini-search-engine

# Data Structures used:-
1. Vector
2. Array/string 
3. Unordered_map
   
# Working of actual search engine:-
The actual search engine works through three primary functions:
1. Crawling:- Search the Internet for content, reviewing the code/content for each URL they find.
2. Indexing:- Store and organize the content found during the crawling process.
3. Ranking:- Provide the content that will best answer a query.


# working & Implementation of my search engine:-
The search engine I made is for my personal use, and its Implementation is also very different from the actual one. It takes the query from the user, searches every word from the query, and opens the URL mapped to this word from the database. If multiple results are found, then It randomly opens one of them and asks the user to press 'n' for the next result, If the first result is not appropriate. If nothing is found in the database, it will open Google, where you can search your query.
